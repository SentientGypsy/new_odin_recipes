        <li><em>2 shallots, diced</em></li>
        <li><em>1 clove garlic, minced</em></li>
        <li><em>2 teaspoons red curry paste</em></li>
        <li><em>1 cup ketchup</em></li>

            <strong>
                Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.
            </strong>
            Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminium foil and set a rack
            over the top. Place the ribs on this rack, meaty side up, and 
            sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place in the oven to 
            slow-cooking.
        </p>
        </li>

                <strong>
                    Place a saucepot over medium heat and add the oil,
                    shallots, and garlic.
                </strong>
                Cook until the shallots are soft and the garlic is fragrant,
                3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the curry paste to coat the shallots
                and garlic, then add the remaining ingredients. Cook for 20
                to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has
                reduced to a semithick sauce. For a smoother sauce, blend 
                the mixture with a submersible blender until no pieces of 
                shallot or garlic remain.

                <strong>
                    The ribs will slow cook for about 3 hours.
                </strong>
                Baste with the sauce every 20 to 30 minutes or so
                (cover the underside a few times, too) until you've got a nice
                thick layer of tangy delicious sauce. Allow to cool slightly after
                cooking, and enjoy.
