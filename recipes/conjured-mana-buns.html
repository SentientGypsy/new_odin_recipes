            You don't have to be a sorcerer to whip up a batch of these
            nutty, soft morsels. Neither the glaze nor the filling is 
            overly sweet, which means you can sneak at least on extra
            to power you through your next adventure.

    <ul>
        <li><em>1 cup brown sugar</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></li>

                <strong>
                    In a large bowl, combine the warm milk and the sugar,
                </strong>
                stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the yeast, followed
                by the butter and the egg, stirring to combine. Add in the salt,
                followed by the flour, gradually, until you have a workable Dough.
                Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until the dough
                bounced back when poked, under 5 minutes. Place in a lightly greased
                bowl, cover, and allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size,
                about an hour. Prep the filling by creaming the dry ingredients with
                the butter; set aside.

                <strong>
                    Butter four muffin tins and set aside
                </strong>
                (or two tins, and work in stages). When the dough has risen, roll it
                out on a lightly floured surface to a large rectangle, roughly 24" x 12".
                Spread the filling evenly ever the surface, leaving only a small strip
                along one longe edge uncovered. Starting on the opposite long edge,
                begin rolling the dough into a tight tube. Using a sharp knife,
                slice the roll every 1 inch, then place one bun in each muffin space
                in the prepared tins. Cover and allow to rise again for about 20 minutes.

                <strong>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
                </strong>
                and bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes, until the topsare golden brown.
                While they are baking, making the glaze: Melt the brown sugar and butter in
                a small saucepan over medium-low heat, then stir in the flour until
                you have no dry lumps. Pour the cream in, and when you have a smooth
                consistency, remove from heat and add the butter and vanilla.

                <strong>
                    When the buns are done, remove them from the oven,
                </strong>
                and while the buns are still warm, move them from the pans
                to a cooling rack. Spoon the glaze over the top of each bun.
                Sprinkle with extra nuts, if you like, and enjoy.
